            <H2 id="mainHeading">Egg puffs</H2>
            <p>Kerala Bakery Style Egg Puffs are a delicious tea time snack with spicy masala hard boiled eggs baked inside crispy puff pastry. <br>
               <li><b>Ingredients :</b>
                  3 boiled eggs,
                  1 sheet puff pastry,
                  ¼ cup all purpose flour for dusting. </li> 
               <li><b>For the onion masala</b>br 
                  1 red onion thinly sliced, 1 tomato medium sized, ½ inch piece of ginger, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon coconut oil, ½ teaspoon ground turmeric, ½ teaspoon cayenne red chilli powder, ½ teaspoon black pepper powder, 1 teaspoon ground fennel,  ½ teaspoon ground coriander, ½ teaspoon garam masala, 1 ½ teaspoon salt change as per your taste, if needed, 1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
               <li><b>To make the onion masala</b><br>
                  In a wide pan over medium heat, heat the coconut oil, add the curry leaves and sliced onions. Once the onions start to turn color add crushed ginger and garlic.
                  Saute for a few minutes till the raw smell of garlic starts to disappear and the onion starts to caramelize and turn brown (not burnt). Add some salt to help fasten this process.
                  Add in the chopped tomatoes and saute for a few more minutes till the tomatoes soften.
                  Now add all the spices - the turmeric powder, red chili powder, black pepper powder, ground fennel, ground coriander and garam masala. Season with salt as well.
                  Saute for a couple of minutes till the spices get cooked. Add a little water, about a tablespoon or so, to the onion masala mixture at this point to keep it from getting burnt.</li>
               <li><b>Puffs Preparation</b><br>
                  Make an egg wash with one egg and a tablespoon of milk whisked well together.
                  Take one square (cut one sheet into 6 roughly equal squares) of the puff pastry, line the edges with the egg wash. This helps keep it together when folded to a parcel.
                  Fill the center of the puff pastry square with about 2 tablespoons of the onion mixture. Add one half of a boiled egg on top of it. Top the egg with a little ( a teaspoon) more of the onion mixture.
                  Now fold the four corners of the puff pastry square so that they overlap over the egg. Press ever so lightly to seal.
                  Brush the top of the puff pastry parcel with the egg wash. Place it on a baking sheet.</li>
                  <li><b>Baking the egg puffs</b><br>
                  Preheat the oven to 400F.
                  Once all the puffs are assembled and placed on the baking sheet, place the sheet in the oven. Bake for 20- 25 minutes till the top is golden brown and the puff pastry has risen and puffed up, hence the name puffs.</li>

            <H2 id="mainHeading">Fried cake (unniyappam)</H2>
            <p> <b>Unni Appam </b> are sweet fritters made with rice, banana, a few spices and coconut. This sweet snack is a popular one in the scenic state of Kerala in South India. This Unniyappam Recipe is quite a nutritious preparation, and is gluten free as well as vegan-friendly too.
               <li><b>How to make Unniyappam </b>
                  Rinse 1 cup of rice in the water a couple of times. Then soak rice in enough water for 3 to 4 hours. You can even soak overnight if you want. Use any short grained rice. I used sona masuri rice.
                  Later drain all the water and add the soaked rice in a grinder jar.
                  Add 2 medium sized banana or about ¾ cup chopped bananas. I have used overripe bananas.
                  Then add ½ cup jaggery powder (or grated jaggery) and seeds from 3 to 4 green cardamom. For a more sweet taste you can add ¾ cup jaggery. 
                  Then add ¼ cup water or add as required.
                  Grind till you get a fine consistency in the rice grains. Grind till you get a semi-fine consistency in the batter.
                  Now pour the batter in another pan or bowl. Keep aside. The batter has a medium consistency.
                  Now heat ½ tablespoon coconut oil or ghee in a small pan or tadka pan. Add 3 tablespoons of chopped coconut pieces.
                  Fry the coconut pieces till they become golden.
                  Add the fried coconut pieces along with the remaining oil in the batter. 
                  Then add 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, ½ teaspoon cumin powder, ½ teaspoon dry ginger powder and ¼ teaspoon baking soda.
                  Stir and mix very well.
                  Now heat the appe chatti pan. Add ½ to 1 teaspoon of coconut oil in each mould. Keep the flame to a low. You can also use ghee instead of coconut oil.
                  On a low to medium-low flame cook till the base is golden and crisp.

            <H2 id="mainHeading">Authentic fish curry </H2>
            <p>Fish Curry is truly an emotion. Specially this kerala fish curry is lip smacking delicious with Kerala red rice. This fish curry is made with onions, ginger, garlic, and spice powders which is cooked in coconut oil. Make this the authentic way with kodampuli to create a red viscous curry sauce 
              <li><b>Preparing Spices :</b>
               Start by soaking tamarind about 10 min in warm water.For authentic taste, You have to cook this curry in claypot for best taste. But you can use regular kadai or pot as well.Add in mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds in hot oil. Let the seeds splutter in oil. Add in finely chopped garlic and ginger, Stir fryfor 2 minutes. 
               Add in finely chopped onions, curry leaves and green chili. When it turns golden brown add spice powders turmeric, red chili, coriander, fenugreek and rost those in 5 seconds. Then add socked tamarind water. Bring this curry to a full boil. Once it starts to boil, let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes on high heat. Add salt to taste and mix well.
               Now add in your fish of choice. You can add any variety as you prefer. here I am using golden pompano. Once fish is added in, reduce the flame and cook on low heat for 5 to 8 minutes. This ensures the fish absorbs all the sauce and gets cooked.
               Fish is cooked completely and oil has separated from the curry, <b>the fish curry is ready to serve</b>.  </li>

             <li><b>For the rice: </b> Biryani rice - 3 cups (jeeraka samba), All whole spices, water - 6 cups, salt- to taste lemon juice - 1tsp</li>  
            </p>
            <p>
               <h3>Briyani Preparation: </h3> <br>
               <b>Biryani Masala:</b> Add all the biryani masala ingredients to a large skillet and roast gently on low heat until fragrant. Cool and grind to a semi-fine powder. Store in an airtight bottle until needed. You can easily scale the recipe up to make a large batch of this masala.
               <br><b>Chicken Masala:</b> Cut up the chicken into large pieces. Wash in water and drain water completely.
               In a large bowl, rub the chicken liberally with the marinade ingredients. Cover tightly with lid and refrigerate for a couple of hours or overnight, if possible. Take the chicken out and bring to room temperature before preparing the chicken masala.
               For chicken masala, make sure you have all the ingredients on hand before starting. Make a paste of cilantro, mint and green chilies by grinding with a little water. Set aside.
               Heat oil in a large, thick-bottomed pan like a Dutch oven or kadhai. Add onions and saute until lightly browned. This will take a while because we have a lot of onions, but keep stirring once in a while to prevent onions from burning or sticking to the bottom.
               Then add the ginger-garlic paste and saute until the raw smell goes away. Keep stirring and saute until onions are fully browned.
               Now add the prepared cilantro-mint-chili paste and mix well. Stir and cook until the mixture is thickened and dark. Now, the base for our chicken masala is done.
               Add the chicken pieces in a single layer and cook for a couple of minutes per side to seal the juices.
               Add biryani masala and the rest of the marinade. Stir to combine everything well and cook for 5 more minutes.
               Add water and salt to taste. Reduce heat once the curry comes to a gentle boil, cover and let it cook until the chicken is tender, around 20-30 minutes or more, depending on the size of the pieces. Keep stirring the curry once in a while.
               Open the lid and thicken the gravy to your liking. Taste and adjust seasoning. The chicken masala can be prepared a day or two in advance and refrigerated until needed.
               <br><b>Biryani Rice:</b> While the chicken is cooking away, you can start on the rice. Wash rice well in cold water 2-3 times or until the water runs clear. Drain rice in a sieve.
               Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a large skillet. Add the drained rice and toast on medium heat, stirring constantly. All the rice should be nicely coated with ghee. Remove from heat and set aside.
               Place a large pan on medium heat and heat 1 tbsp of ghee. Add cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and bay leaves and fry them lightly.
               Now add water, salt and lemon juice. Bring to a boil and add the toasted rice. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until rice is almost done, but not mushy.
               Drain rice immediately and discard the cooking liquid. Fluff rice gently and spread on a large platter or baking sheet to cool slightly.
               Garnishes: Heat oil in a pan. Add cashew nuts and raisins and fry until raisins are puffy and cashew nuts are golden. Remove with a slotted spoon to a bowl and set aside.
               In the same oil, fry the sliced onions until fully browned. Drain onto a paper towel lined plate. As it cools, the onions will crisp up. The fried onions or birista can be made and stored several days ahead.
              <br><b> Dum Cooking:</b> Select a deep, thick-bottomed pan like a Dutch oven or pressure cooker. Make sure the pan is oven-safe if you decide to use the oven for dum cooking the biryani.
               Spread a tablespoon of ghee in the bottom, and then a thin layer of chicken gravy in the pan. Spread half of the rice on top. Arrange the chicken pieces on top along with some of the gravy. Sprinkle half of the garnishes (fried onions, nuts, raisins, chopped cilantro and mint leaves) on the chicken. Spread the rest of the rice on top. Sprinkle the rest of the garnishes over the rice. Sprinkle a teaspoon of biryani masala powder, if you have any left over. Dollop the last tablespoon of ghee on top.
               Cover the pan tightly with foil, then with a heavy lid. Cook biryani on low heat placing the pan over a heat diffuser for 20 minutes. Or you can bake for 20 minutes in an oven that has been pre-heated to 325 deg.F.
               <br><b>Serving:</b> Let the prepared biryani sit for 10 minutes before removing the lid. Gently fluff the biryani to combine everything together. Serve with sides like raita, chutneys, pickles, pappads, etc. The chicken biryani is usually served with a boiled egg on top.</p>
